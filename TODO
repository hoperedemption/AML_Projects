--> Fit Kernel Ridge for feature selection, select the features based on importance of the coefficients
--> Fit Lasso and Elastic Net and select features based on the importance of the coefficients

See if these technqiues improve our results or not

--> Even further outlier detection either by projecting with TSNE and/or PCA and fitting an Isolation Tree and/or Elliptic Envelope to the Data. This should be done jointly (x, y) --> also not forget to scale the data, i saw imporvement with RobustScaler, although we can in theory also do QuantileTransformation ...

--> More fine grain outlier detection within the train set - VIF, ANOVA (idk how to use that)

--> Train more model, at some point we can also try a NN Regressor

--> Play around with Voting and Stacking Regressors
